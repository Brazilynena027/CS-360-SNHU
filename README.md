Mobile Architect and Programming

1.Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The Events Calendar app's goal is to efficiently manage and organize schedules, appointments, and events. The requirements of the app are to streamline event related details. Send push notifications when events are upcoming. Allow users to add new events to the calendar view, delete outdated or canceled events and modify existing event entries. 

2.What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

My app consists of 7 screens. the main screen would be the Login screen for users with existing accounts as well as a button which take new users to another screen to register. After registration and.or login users would have access to the calendar view screen which would show a calender with all events. Clicking on a day would open up another screen for the view of events. from the screen you can modify the event or delete the event. which would open up those respective screens for those events. There is also an allow permissions screens that allows users to choose yes or no to push notifications. from calendar view there will also be an option to add a new event to calendar and would take you to another screen to fill out the details of that event. 

3.How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the process in designing my app by first looking at other apps that were similar to see what they offered and considered how I could implement a simliar approach. After completing that research, I began with the first screen the user would see, the login screen. I started off designing the Layout first once I was satisfied, I began writing the code. I continued this process throught the entirety of the app. 

4.How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

In hindsight, I wrote the whole code first then tried to test which resulted in a non functional app. Looking back I would have started with the first screen then the second to see If my intent was set up coorectly so I could switch to the next screen upon clicking the login.reset or sign in buttons. I will continue to work on this to work through these issues.

5.Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The planning was not the hard part of this process. it was getting the code to properly work. I tried to innovate however I did not succeed in a working app. I hope to in the future over come these issues. 

6.In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I felt I was most sucessful in creating my calendar view. Prior to completing the full app I was able to created a functional app the moved throughtout the months and each day was clickable and pulled up the day view.
